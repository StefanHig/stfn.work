Hi, my name is Stefan. I'm interested in how technology *works for people*. What kinds of stories do we tell with the tools we use? How does the often invisible *stuff* (the hard-, soft-, and firm-ware) with which these tools are made influence how we use them and what we do with them?

Iâ€™m a researcher and communicator on technology and media. I combine technical, design-based, and social science methods. I was previously an interdisciplinary academic researcher with foci in English, media and technology, and urban policy. On my [work page](/work) you can find out more about some stuff I've been up to recently, and on my [experience page](/experience) you can see, well, my experience.

In my spare time, I like to read science fiction, take photos (which you can see via the [photography page](/photography)), run, cook (especially soups), and root for the eternally painful-to-watch Vancouver Canucks.
